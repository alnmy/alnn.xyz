terms/ideas such as "web3" and "blockchain" are pushed by twitter-using retards who can't stop using proprietary webdev software, so they try and push their shitty ideas (NFTs, etc) on spyware (twitter) which they can't stop using. these retards should use software which is designed to be free from the very beginning and are ACTUALLY USEFUL (not nfts, i don't give a shit that you own a json file which points to a jpeg on a centralised server) like torrents.
if these crypto/nft/web3 evangelists are so against centralised platforms, etc, why are they all using twitter? why not.. you know create your own website or use a federated platform like mastadon/pleroma/matrix?  
does mail count as web3 because it's decentralised?
